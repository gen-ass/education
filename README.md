# Education
Design proposal was presented to the particular Faculty to change the landing page in line with the Corporate Identity guide of the University. 

## What was used
The final product was rendered using a combination SharePoint 2013 web parts and embedding the HTML, CSS and JavaScript into the .aspx server file.

## Who was involved
Collaboration was done between me and the University web coordinators, they provided access to particular web parts which I utilised to render the page. It was also their prerogative to make sure the styling was in line with the University’s Corporate Identity guide.

## Continued support
The agreement was between me and the Faculty was to maintain the page for a defined period as the development was not to be supported by the University’s web coordinators. The design was utilised for a period until the complete website was re-deigned by the University.
